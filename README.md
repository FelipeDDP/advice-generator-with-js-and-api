## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com)


### What I learned

This is essentially my first ever project fetching from an API. Even though I was already happy with how the original JavaScript had turned out, I'm glad I revisited it and learned about object destructuring, which made my code cleaner.

I also had a good time revisiting some CSS basics which had gone over my head, like the proper way of applying max-width in tandem with flexbox in order to make my container flexible to only a certain extent.
